15. git push --all pushed all the branches to the project.  
16. git pull is used to get the latest revision of the project that is not available in the local repository yet.  
17. Markdown is a way to style text on the web.

          	README.md  
          
          nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)    
    11. git add --all  
        atiqur@Winston testdir % git commit -m "update readme"

    13. Deleted the testdif folder. -rf removed it by force.  
23. A relative path is the one that is with respect to the working directory. Whereas an absolute path includes the whole path starting from the root like a url. It is better to use a relative path in GitHub because even if someone uses it in their local system, it would not mess up the path.
