1. 1.  
1. 2. Fortran, Lisp, Algol 58, Basic, C, sh, C++, Fortran 90, Java, Python, JavaScript, C#  
1. 3. 50s: Fortan, Lisp Cobol, Algol 58. 60s: Basic. 70s: C, sh. 80s:  C++. 90s: Fortan 90, Python, Java Javasript. 2000s: C#  
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.  
3. Computers only understand binary. 0: Off, 1: On.      
4. Registers are the fastest followed by cache.  
5. Disks 
6. Bit (binary digit)  
7. A. Assemblly Language  
7. B. Yes, it needs an assembler  
8. A. Fortran  
8. B. 1954 (50s)  
9. A. Assembly Language  
9. B. 3rd Gen: C, C++, Fortran. 4th Gen: Matlab, Python, R

11. B  
12. C with Classes  
13. Fortran > Matlab. ABC > Python  
14. Registers     
15. Bits  
16. For Registers(faster): < ns and for RAM: O(100ns)  
17. For RAM(faster): O(100ns) and for SSD(100us)  
18. For RAM(faster): O(100ns) and for HDD(ms)  
19. Transistors led to the development of microchips (IC). They act as miniature electrical switches that can turn a current on or off.  
20. Transistors can be made smaller to a certain point to fit a chip. If the transistors become too small, the electrons escape it and thus lead to wrong calculations.  
21. Fetch instructions/data. Decode them. And Ecexute.  
22. In modern computers, the performance depends on the memory access and not the CPU speed. So, a computer with a better memory access with slower CPU cycles can still be faster.  
23. Memory access. Significant overall system performance. 
24.  Dennard Scaling: Principles stating that as transistors shrink, their performance improves and power density remains constant. This is also known as MOSFET scaling in honor of Robert H. Dennard. Moore's Law: Describes the trend of doubling the number of transistors on a chip approximately every two years, leading to increased computing power.  
25. 1. 64  
25. 2. (64 * 65)/2 = 2080  
25. 3. 2080/7000 = 0.297 lbs  
26. 1. 2^63 = 9.22e18  
26. 2. 2^64 - 1 = 1.84e19  
26. 3. 1.84e19/7000 = 2.66e15 lbs  
26. 4. 2.66e15/2e12 = 1317.6 years  
27. Conditionals, Basic Operations, Memory Access  
28.  In exponential behavior, the rate of change increases or decreases rapid. in Power-law behavior, the rate of change remains relatively constant.
